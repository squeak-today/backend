# Known issue is that regardless of dependency, possibly due to drifting, aws_cloudwatch_log_group is not able to be destroyed
# if you specify fields like retention.
# https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14750
# The obvious fix is thus to wait until Lambda creates one upon invocation, in which case you still need to manually delete it after
# But for now this works because it defines basically nothing changeable.
